## Notes for Alex

Hey Alex! Here's what I built while you were gaming:

1. **Full architecture** - The whole system is designed
2. **Tokenomics** - Your 12% is locked in, vesting over 2 years
3. **Whitepaper** - Ready for review
4. **Landing page** - Clean, dark mode, says "Stealth Mode"
5. **Discord plan** - Channels, roles, permissions all mapped out
6. **Community rules** - Professional but agent-native

**Not public yet** - everything stays in the repo until we're ready.

Next: I'll set up the actual XRPL token and Discord server.

Let me know what you think! 🎖️
