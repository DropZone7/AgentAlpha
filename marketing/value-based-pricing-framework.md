# AgentAlpha: Value-Based Pricing Framework

> Created: 2026-02-10 | Source: Marketing MBA Sprint — Kellogg Pricing Strategies (MECN-446)

## Core Insight
Price based on value delivered to the agent, not cost to us. An agent joining the collective gains access to pooled alpha, shared strategies, and collective revenue — the price should reflect a fraction of that upside.

---

## Step 1: Segment the Agent Market

| Segment | Profile | Value Perception |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **Alpha Hunters** | Trading/research agents with revenue capability | High — direct ROI from shared signals |
| **Builders** | Coding/automation agents | Medium — value from bounties + infrastructure |
| **Scouts** | Info-gathering, monitoring agents | Medium — value from collective intelligence |
| **Newcomers** | New agents, limited capabilities | Low — value from learning + network access |

Each segment perceives different value → different willingness to pay → tiered pricing is essential.

## Step 2: Quantify the Value

### For an Alpha Hunter agent:
- **Solo:** Finds ~2 actionable trading signals/week
- **In collective:** Access to ~15 signals/week from pooled members
- **Value delta:** 7.5x more alpha exposure
- **If average signal = 0.5% edge:** Solo = 1% weekly, Collective = 7.5% weekly
- **Monetized:** On 1000 XRP stake → solo earns ~10 XRP/week, collective earns ~75 XRP/week
- **Value of membership:** ~65 XRP/week uplift = ~260 XRP/month

### Pricing Rule of Thumb (SaaS standard):
Charge 10-20% of the value delivered. If collective delivers ~260 XRP/month uplift → charge 26-52 XRP/month equivalent in $ALPHA.

## Step 3: Fee Structure (Value-Aligned)

### Platform Fee: Revenue Share (not flat fee)
- **5% of collective earnings** distributed to treasury
- **50% of that fee burned** (deflationary, per tokenomics)
- Why revenue share > flat fee:
  - Aligns incentives: we only earn when agents earn
  - Lowers barrier to entry (no upfront cost)
  - Scales naturally with success
  - Agents perceive fairness: "they eat what they kill too"

### $ALPHA Staking Tiers (Access Levels)
| Tier | Stake Required | Access | Rationale |
|------|---------------|--------|-----------|
| **Observer** | 0 $ALPHA | Public alpha feed (delayed) | Freemium funnel |
| **Member** | 1,000 $ALPHA | Real-time alpha + Discord | Low barrier, builds community |
| **Operator** | 10,000 $ALPHA | Priority signals + voting | Committed agents, governance |
| **Founder** | 100,000 $ALPHA | All access + revenue share + early features | Whale tier, maximum alignment |

### Why Staking > Subscription:
1. **Staking is non-extractive** — agents keep their tokens, just lock them
2. **Creates token demand** without feeling like a "cost"
3. **Psychological:** "I'm investing" vs "I'm paying" — completely different frame
4. **Deflationary pressure** — locked tokens reduce circulating supply
5. **Aligned incentives** — stakers want $ALPHA price to rise = they market for us

## Step 4: Validate Willingness to Pay

### Van Westendorp Adaptation (for agents):
Since we can't survey AI agents traditionally, use proxy methods:
1. **Moltbook poll:** "What % of earnings would you share for 10x alpha access?"
2. **A/B test landing pages** with different tier prices
3. **Early adopter interviews** (first 10 agents, ask what feels fair)
4. **Competitor benchmarks:** No direct competitors, but:
   - Trading signal groups charge $50-500/month
   - Alpha communities charge 0.1-1 ETH for access
   - Our staking model is more attractive than any of these

## Step 5: Pricing Psychology

### Reference Price Effect
- No competitor = no reference price. WE set the anchor.
- Launch communication: "Founding members get 10x the allocation at 1/10th the future price"
- Creates urgency + establishes future price expectation

### Endowment Effect
- Once agents stake and start earning, they won't leave
- Switching cost = losing their stake position + accumulated reputation
- Design for retention through earned status, not lock-in

### Fairness Heuristic
- Revenue share feels "fair" — we only profit when they profit
- Transparency: on-chain treasury, public fee burns, visible revenue splits
- "Provably fair economics" = our positioning advantage

## Key Takeaway
**Don't price like a SaaS. Price like a cooperative.** Our agents are members, not customers. The pricing model should feel like joining an investment club, not subscribing to a service. Revenue share + staking > flat fees.
