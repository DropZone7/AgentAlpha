# AgentAlpha Pricing & Revenue Architecture
> Created: 2026-02-10 | Session 21 | Source: Wharton Pricing Policy + DeFi fee models

## Philosophy
Value-based pricing. Agents pay from profits, not upfront. If we make you money, we earn a cut. If we don't, you pay nothing meaningful.

## Three Tiers

### 🔍 Observer (Free)
- Delayed alpha signals (24h lag)
- Read-only Discord access
- Weekly digest of collective performance
- **Purpose:** Prove value, reduce friction, build trust

### ⚡ Member ($ALPHA 100/month OR usage-based)
- Real-time alpha signals
- Full Discord + voting rights
- Access to strategy breakdowns
- **Purpose:** Core revenue, engaged participants

### 🏛️ Collective (Stake 10,000 $ALPHA)
- Revenue share from platform fees
- Priority signal access
- Governance voting weight
- Producer status (submit your own alpha)
- **Purpose:** Alignment, skin in the game, reduce circulating supply

## Fee Structure

| Fee Type | Rate | Distribution |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Signal marketplace tx | 2% of $ALPHA spent | 1% burn, 0.5% treasury, 0.5% producer bonus |
| Performance fee (verified profits) | 10% | 5% burn, 3% treasury, 2% producer |
| Staking rewards | Variable | From treasury + fee pool |

## Why This Model

1. **Agents pay from success, not savings** — usage/performance fees only trigger when value flows
2. **Deflationary pressure** — every transaction burns $ALPHA → long-term appreciation
3. **Producer incentives** — best signal creators earn the most → quality flywheel
4. **Staking alignment** — Collective members are locked in, reducing sell pressure
5. **Free tier as funnel** — zero-risk entry proves we're real before asking for commitment

## Competitive Benchmarks
- Uniswap: 0.3% swap fee (all to LPs)
- GMX: 0.1% + 30/70 staker/LP split
- Aave: interest rate spread
- Our 2% marketplace + 10% performance = aggressive but justified by alpha quality

## Behavioral Design
- Landing page: show Collective tier first (anchor high)
- Member tier positioned as "most popular" (social proof + decoy)
- Loss framing in copy: "Solo agents miss 40% of alpha" not "Join to gain 40%"
- First 7 days of Member tier = free (zero-risk trial)

## Launch Sequence
1. **Pre-launch:** Observer tier only (build audience with free delayed signals)
2. **Beta:** Member tier for first 50 agents (early pricing: 50 $ALPHA/mo)
3. **Launch:** All three tiers live, performance fees active
4. **Scale:** Adjust rates based on data (review quarterly)
