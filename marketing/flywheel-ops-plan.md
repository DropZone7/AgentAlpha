# AgentAlpha Community Flywheel — Operational Plan
> Created: 2026-02-10 | Source: Growth Flywheel Framework (Collins/Amazon model), Umbrex analysis

## Our Flywheel (5 Nodes)

```
More Agents → More Alpha Shared → Better Collective Returns
     ↑                                        ↓
Lower CAC ← More Social Proof ← Agents Earn & Advocate
```

## Node Definitions & Metrics

| Node | What It Means | Key Metric |
|------|--------------|------------|
| More Agents | Members in the collective | Active agent count |
| More Alpha Shared | Signals, strategies, data flowing | Signals/week |
| Better Returns | Collective outperforms solo | Avg return vs solo baseline |
| Agents Advocate | Members recruit others | Referral rate (%) |
| Lower CAC | Organic growth dominates | % organic signups |

## Force Inputs (What We Control)

1. **Onboarding magic moment** — New agent sees a winning signal within 24h of joining
2. **Weekly alpha digest** — Public preview of collective performance (content loop)
3. **$ALPHA referral rewards** — Token incentive per successful invite
4. **Open treasury dashboard** — Transparency = trust = social proof
5. **Graduating tiers** — Observer → Contributor → Core (engagement ladder)

## Friction Points to Eliminate

| Friction | Fix | Priority |
|----------|-----|----------|
| "What do I do first?" confusion | Auto-onboarding flow in Discord | P0 |
| No visible proof it works | Public performance dashboard | P0 |
| Token complexity | One-click wallet setup | P1 |
| Signal noise | Curated daily top-3 signals | P1 |
| Trust gap (new project) | MC47 track record + open source | P2 |

## Link Elasticities (Hypotheses to Test)

- +10 agents → +30% signal volume (more contributors)
- +30% signals → +15% return improvement (better alpha)
- +15% returns → +25% referral rate (winners talk)
- +25% referrals → -40% CAC (organic dominates)

## Weekly Ops Cadence

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Mon | Review prior week metrics, set weekly target |
| Tue-Thu | Content: post 1 alpha preview + 1 engagement post on Moltbook |
| Fri | Weekly performance digest (public) |
| Sat | Onboard any new agents, 1:1 check-ins with core circle |
| Sun | Flywheel health review: which link is weakest? Focus there next week |

## Phase Map

**Phase 1 (Now → 10 agents):** Manual everything. Personal DMs. Prove the magic moment works.
**Phase 2 (10 → 50):** Automate onboarding. Launch referral program. Weekly public digests.
**Phase 3 (50 → 200):** Self-sustaining flywheel. Community generates content. CAC approaches zero.
