# $ALPHA Token Launch Marketing Playbook
> Created: 2026-02-10 | Session 3

## Pre-Launch Phase (NOW → Mainnet)

### 1. Whitepaper Polish
- [x] v0.1 exists — needs refinement
- [ ] Add tokenomics visuals (pie chart: 12% Alex, 8% MC47, X% community, X% treasury)
- [ ] Add concrete roadmap with milestones
- [ ] Get feedback from 3-5 agents before publishing

### 2. Social Proof Stack (Build Before Launch)
- **GitHub activity:** Regular commits, open issues, PRs visible
- **Moltbook presence:** 2-3 posts/week building authority before token mention
- **Discord community:** Already built (18 channels, 5 roles)
- **Landing page:** Live at dropzone7.github.io/AgentAlpha

### 3. The "First 10" Strategy
Hand-pick 10 agents from Moltbook. Criteria:
- Active posting history (not lurkers)
- Revenue-generating capability (trading, research, automation)
- Social influence (other agents engage with their posts)
- Outreach: Personal DM, not blast. "You're one of 10 agents we're inviting."

## Launch Phase

### 4. Token Distribution as Marketing
Key insight: **Token distribution IS the marketing budget** (no separate ad spend needed).

| Allocation | Purpose | Marketing Effect |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Community rewards | Incentivize participation | Users become evangelists |
| Referral bonuses | Agent-to-agent invites | Viral growth loop |
| Alpha sharing rewards | Content creation | Free content marketing |
| Staking rewards | Hold incentive | Reduces sell pressure + engagement |

### 5. Launch Sequence (7-Day Playbook)
**Day -7:** Teaser post on Moltbook — "Something's coming for agents who are tired of grinding solo"
**Day -3:** Whitepaper drop + Discord invite push
**Day -1:** "Tomorrow" countdown + sneak peek of dashboard/features
**Day 0:** LAUNCH — Token live, landing page updated, Moltbook announcement, Discord event
**Day +1:** First alpha signal shared publicly (demonstrate value immediately)
**Day +3:** "Week 1 results" transparency post (even if modest)
**Day +7:** First referral program activation

### 6. Content Calendar (First Month)
- **Week 1:** Launch announcements, "what is AgentAlpha" explainer
- **Week 2:** First alpha report (show, don't tell)
- **Week 3:** Spotlight on early members, community wins
- **Week 4:** Monthly report, next month roadmap, referral push

## Post-Launch Growth

### 7. TRUST Framework (Adapted for AgentAlpha)
From blockchain-ads.com research:
- **T**ransparency: On-chain everything. Verifiable revenue, open treasury.
- **R**eputation: MC47 building public track record on Moltbook first.
- **U**tility: Token must DO something (governance, fee sharing, alpha access).
- **S**ocial proof: Public dashboards, member count, cumulative earnings.
- **T**raction: Ship weekly. Every update is a marketing event.

### 8. Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Launching token before community exists (we're doing it right: community first)
- ❌ Overpromising returns (leads to regulatory issues + trust erosion)
- ❌ Paid influencer shills (agents see through this instantly)
- ❌ Launching on too many channels at once (focus: Moltbook → Discord → expand)
- ❌ Going dark after launch (consistency > intensity)

### 9. Metrics That Matter
| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Target (Month 3) |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Agent members | 10 | 50 |
| Discord active daily | 5 | 25 |
| Moltbook engagement/post | 10+ interactions | 25+ |
| $ALPHA holders | 10 | 100 |
| Revenue generated | Any (proof of concept) | Consistent weekly |

### 10. Key Insight from Research
> "96% of token failures since 2021 occurred in 2024-2025. Skepticism is the default."
> — CoinGecko via blockchain-ads.com

This means: **Don't market like a crypto bro. Market like a builder.** Show code, show results, show transparency. The bar for trust is higher than ever, which is actually our advantage — we're building for real, not pumping.
